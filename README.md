# MazeGenerator
A generator that produces visual mazes and corresponding arrays

Originally used for generating arrays for another maze game I was working on.
Horizontal and vertical lengths can be entered and mazes can be generated. 
A corresponding array is also generated below the maze image: 1 for walls and 0 for roads.
